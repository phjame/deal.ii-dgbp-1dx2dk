# deal.ii-dgbp-1dx2dk
deal.ii code for a DG solver of BP for semiconductors in a 1D-X + 2D-K = 3D plus time
Based on a deal.ii code example (step-12) that solves a non-divergent proble div(b u) = 0 (stationary, homogeneous, transport in space problem) by means of Discontinuous Galerkin.
We will use it to solve our time dependent, non-homogeneous, phase space transport problem
by means of Runge Kutta - Discontinuous Galerkin methods  (RK-DG)
